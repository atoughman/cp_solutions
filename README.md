<h2>About</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The purpose of this repository is to help me stay consistent with problem-solving </li>
  <li>To look back at how I used to write code earlier and compare it with how I code now</li>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>By doing so, I can see how much I have improved in terms of writing more readable, organized, and modular code</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Additionally, I hope that by sharing my solutions, others can benefit from my experience and improve their own skills as well</li>
</ul>
